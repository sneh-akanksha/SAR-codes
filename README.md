# SAR-codes
These folders contain the MATLAB codes for implementing a GUI for synthetic aperture radar imaging.
The main file name to be executed on MATLAB is 'SAR_new_exported.m' in all the zipped folders.
The first version of the code is uploaded in the file 'SAR_GUI_v1'. This folder includes a GUI to perform coarse MOCOMP for motion errors in the SAR image.
The second version of the code is uploaded in the file 'SAR_GUI_v2'. This folder includes the fine MOCOMP (CCR and PGA) integrated in the previous GUI.
